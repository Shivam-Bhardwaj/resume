## Experience Details
- **Multi-Modal Robotic Forensics:** Architected a robotic workcell for counterfeit detection in server systems, integrating **RF, Thermal (+/- 0.5°C), Capacitance, and Optical** (85mm industrial lens) sensing to achieve **0.5% repeatability**.
- **EV Conversion & Simulation:** Led the mechanical reverse-engineering for a **Class-8 Diesel-to-Electric** conversion (AAA); executed **3D scan post-processing** and **Harmonic Analysis** to validate structural integrity and transient response of mounting systems.
- **AR Hardware Development:** Managed the mechanical and industrial design of a **Waveguide Frame** for a semiconductor research lab; coordinated with vendors for high-fidelity finishing (painting/3D printing) to meet **tight tolerance specifications** for executive demos.
- **Feasibility & Automation:** Conducted feasibility studies for **containerized ad-hoc EV charging** and **datacenter server pin testing automation**, delivering technical roadmaps for niche industrial problems.

## Raw Input
AES is a specialized research firm for mechanical engineering design and simulation, partnering with industry leaders to solve niche problems.
- **Robotic System:** Developed a system to identify counterfeit components in consumer/server products. Integrated multi-modal sensing: RF, Thermal (+/- 0.5°C accuracy), Capacitance for material analysis, and Optical (85mm industrial camera with specialized lighting). Achieved 0.5% repeatability/accuracy.
- **Drive-by-Wire (AAA):** Worked on converting diesel trucks to electric. Managed professional 3D scanning, performed scan cleaning/post-processing to identify structural components, and conducted harmonic analysis to identify transient responses.
- **AR Glasses:** Developed a frame for a light waveguide (semiconductor research lab). Managed industrial/mechanical design under tight specs and coordinated high-quality finishing (painting over 3D prints) for presentable prototypes.
- **Other:** Feasibility studies for containerized ad-hoc car charging, e-cigarettes, and datacenter automation for server pin testing.

## AI Critique
**Technical Sanity Check:**
- **Sensing Modalities:** The inclusion of specific modalities (RF, Thermal, Capacitance) adds significant technical weight compared to generic "sensors".
- **Simulation:** Mentioning "Harmonic Analysis" and "Transient Response" correctly identifies advanced FEA/simulation capabilities relevant to structural engineering.
- **Precision:** "0.5% repeatability" and "+/- 0.5°C" are good, concrete metrics.

**Job Market Fit:**
- **Robotics & Automation:** Strong fit for roles involving sensor fusion and automated inspection.
- **EV/Automotive:** The "Diesel-to-Electric" and "Harmonic Analysis" keywords are highly relevant for automotive structural/systems engineering roles.
- **Consumer Electronics/AR:** Experience with "Waveguides" and "Industrial Design" management is valuable for product design roles in big tech (Meta, Apple, etc.).
- **Generalist Engineering:** The breadth (EV, AR, Robotics, Datacenters) positions you well for "Solutions Architect" or "Engineering Manager" roles where versatility is key.
