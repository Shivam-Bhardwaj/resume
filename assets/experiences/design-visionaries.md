## Experience Details
- **AutoCrate Design Engine:** Invented a parametric design engine by reverse-engineering **Siemens NX Expressions** (bypassing slow NX Open API), reducing design time from **5 days to <1 hour**. Built a **React/Python** GUI to generate ASTM-compliant drawings, increasing custom crate adoption from **20% to 50%**.
- **AR Glasses Electronics:** Designed a **10-layer Flex PCB** for AR glasses, integrating an **Ambiq MCU**, USB power delivery, micro-projector data path, and **I2C** ambient light sensing within a compact form factor.
- **Harness Production Scaling:** Scaled harness production from **25 to 70 units/day** (2.8x increase) and reduced RMA rate from **70% to 10%** by implementing lean manufacturing systems and optimizing assembly workflows.
- **Custom Instrumentation:** Invented a real-time **Laser/LDR** soil leveling sensor for slurry injection, solving a critical feedback gap where CV failed. Developed an automated metrology machine for recycled metal classification.
- **MBD & GD&T:** Transitioned a major semiconductor lab (Plasma ALD) from 2D drawings to **Model-Based Definition (MBD)** in NX, defining **GD&T** and PMI directly in 3D models to meet critical deadlines.

## Raw Input
Design Visionaries specializes in Siemens NX training and design.
- **AutoCrate:** Automated NX by reverse-engineering expressions files (Python) instead of using the slow NX Open API. Reduced design time from 5 days to <1 hour and increased custom crate usage from 20% to 50%.
- **Harnesses:** Increased production from 25 to 70 harnesses/day and improved quality from ~70% failure rate (RMA) to 90% success rate by setting up new systems.
- **AR Glasses:** Developed a 10-layer flex PCB SOC with Ambiq MCU, USB select, power circuit, micro-projector data, and I2C ambient light sensor.
- **Soil Leveling Invention:** Invented a rotating laser + vertical LDR pole system to measure real-time ground leveling during slurry injection ("botox for parks"), solving issues with water levels/CV.
- **Metrology:** Built an automated machine to measure dimensions/materials for a recycled metal supplier.
- **MBD/PMI:** Assisted a semiconductor lab (Plasma ALD) in moving from 2D drawings to Model-Based Definition (MBD/PMI) in NX, applying GD&T to meet deadlines.

## AI Critique
**Technical Sanity Check:**
- **NX Expressions vs. Open:** This is a deep cut. Knowing that NX Open can be slow/clunky and bypassing it via direct expression manipulation demonstrates "Hacker" level mastery of the tool.
- **Electronics:** "10-layer Flex PCB" is a significant complexity indicator. Mentioning specific components (Ambiq, I2C, Micro-projector) adds credibility.
- **MBD/PMI:** This is a hot topic in modern manufacturing (Industry 4.0). Moving away from 2D drawings is a major value add for enterprise clients.

**Job Market Fit:**
- **Mechatronics/Robotics:** The blend of Mechanical (NX, GD&T), Electrical (Flex PCB, Sensors), and Software (Python, React) is the definition of a strong Mechatronics profile.
- **Manufacturing Engineer:** The harness production scaling (25->70/day) and RMA reduction are perfect metrics for manufacturing roles.
- **R&D:** The "Soil Leveling" invention shows the ability to solve novel problems with first-principles engineering (Laser + LDRs).
