## Experience Details
- **Makerspace Operations (Manager):** Operated and maintained fabrication equipment (**3D printing, laser cutting, CNC routing, waterjet, electronics lab**) and coached **50–150** student project teams on safe prototyping and iteration.
- **Self-Driving VIP (Founder/Lead):** Secured dean funding and converted the team into a **Vertically Integrated Project (VIP)**; led a ~**12**-person team to place **1st** in Novel Design and **3rd** overall execution at the **26th** IGVC.
- **Autonomy Stack (IGVC):** Led integration of sensors + compute and guided development of **ROS-based** navigation, including motion planning (e.g., RRT, RRT\*, A\*) and **PID** control for an autonomous ground vehicle.

## Raw Input
During my Master’s at NYU Tandon, I managed the Tandon Makerspace, maintaining equipment (3D printers, laser cutters, CNC router, waterjet, electronics lab) and helping students with projects. I also founded a self-driving team, secured funding from the dean, converted it into a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP), grew it to ~12 members, and earned awards at the 26th IGVC (1st in Novel Design; 3rd overall execution).

## AI Critique
**Role Alignment & Impact:**
- **Leadership:** Makerspace management and founding a VIP team demonstrate leadership, mentorship, and cross-functional coordination.
- **Hands-on Prototyping:** Strong fabrication + rapid iteration experience is directly relevant to robotics systems work.

**Improvements:**
- **More Metrics:** If you remember how much funding was secured, number of competition teams, or frequency of lab sessions, we can strengthen the bullets further.
