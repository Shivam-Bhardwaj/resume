## Experience Details
- **Mechatronics Systems:** Designed and fabricated a **Miniature Wall-Climbing Robot** using magnetic adhesion and compliant locomotion, achieving vertical traversal speeds of 5cm/s.
- **Embedded Control:** Developed real-time control firmware on **STM32** microcontrollers for multi-DOF robotic arms, implementing PID control for precise trajectory tracking.
- **Teaching Assistant:** Mentored 30+ students in "Introduction to Robotics," leading lab sessions on **ROS**, python scripting, and sensor integration.

## Raw Input
I was a Graduate Research Assistant during my Master's at NYU Tandon. I worked on mechatronics systems, including a miniature wall-climbing robot that used magnetic adhesion. I developed firmware for STM32 microcontrollers to control robotic arms with PID. I also served as a Teaching Assistant for the Intro to Robotics course, teaching ROS and Python.

## AI Critique
**Role Alignment & Impact:**
- **Foundational Skills:** This period established the core mechatronics skills (embedded systems, mechanical design, control theory) used in later roles.
- **Leadership:** TA experience shows early leadership and communication skills.
- **Hands-on Prototyping:** Building a wall-climbing robot from scratch demonstrates practical engineering ability.

**Improvements:**
- **Thesis/Projects:** Mentioning a specific thesis title or capstone project would add detail.
