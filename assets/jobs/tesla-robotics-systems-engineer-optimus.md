# Robotics Systems Engineer, Optimus

## What to Expect

Tesla is seeking an on-site Robotics Systems Integration Engineer in Palo Alto, CA. This engineer will act as the subsystem expert during design, bring-up and ramp for multiple low voltage systems, power electronics, and subsequent sensing solution. This engineer is responsible for challenging existing designs and using a first principles' approach to innovating and accelerating novel architecture and design.

## What You'll Do

- Define system and component level requirements through first principles analysis and hardware/model-based testing
- Prototype and characterize components and full systems to ensure target metrics are met
- Design and develop early system prototypes to de-risk new technologies
- Understand and highlight n-th order impacts of electrical, software, or process changes
- Triage and debug hardware and software interactions during design, launch, and deployment
- Be responsible for overall functional and performance readiness of a system and its features during the full product life cycle
- Analyze the failure modes and complete full DFMEAs/HARAs to ensure a safe subsystem design

## What You'll Bring

- Degree in engineering or related field or, equivalent experience
- Strong electrical and embedded systems fundamentals
- Hands-on technical experience debugging complex subsystems involving network microprocessors and software-controlled electrical or electromechanical devices
- Ability to read and interpret C/C++ or similar embedded systems languages
- Strong written and verbal communication skills
- Experience in MATLAB, Python, or equivalent tools for modeling and analysis
- Proficient in data visualization
- Experience in failure modes analysis, HARA and FTA
