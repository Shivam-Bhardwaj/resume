# Resume Design Rules

These rules are used by the automated critique system to validate resume content.

1.  **Quantifiable Metrics:** Every bullet point describing professional experience MUST include at least one quantifiable metric (e.g., "improved by 20%", "reduced latency by 5ms", "managed $50k budget").
2.  **Action Verbs:** Start every bullet point with a strong action verb (e.g., "Designed", "Architected", "implemented", "Optimized"). Avoid passive voice.
3.  **Brevity:** Bullet points should ideally be 1 line, max 2 lines. Concise communication is key.
4.  **Relevance:** Ensure the content highlights engineering impact and technical difficulty.
5.  **Specific Tech:** Mention specific technologies used (e.g., "Rust", "C++", "SLAM", "React") rather than generic terms.
