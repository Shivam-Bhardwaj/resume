## Experience Details
- **Autonomous Construction:** Researched **Collective Robotic Construction (CRC)**, developing algorithms for multi-agent systems to build structures autonomously.
- **Computer Vision:** Implemented **SLAM** and object detection pipelines for real-time site monitoring and robot localization in dynamic environments.
- **Research Publication:** Contributed to research findings on **topological structural analysis** for robotic assembly, laying groundwork for future lab publications.

## Raw Input
I was a Visiting Researcher at the AI4CE Lab under Professor Chen Feng. I focused on autonomous construction using Collective Robotic Construction (CRC) methods. My work involved developing algorithms for multi-agent systems. I also worked on computer vision tasks, specifically SLAM and object detection for robot localization. I contributed to research on topological analysis for robotic assembly.

## AI Critique
**Role Alignment & Impact:**
- **Academic Rigor:** Working in a research lab under a professor demonstrates strong theoretical foundations.
- **Cutting-Edge Tech:** "Collective Robotic Construction" and "SLAM" are advanced topics in robotics.
- **Foundation for Innovation:** This role likely provided the deep technical background for later industrial work.

**Improvements:**
- **Specific Publications:** If there are specific paper titles or conferences, adding them would significantly boost credibility.
