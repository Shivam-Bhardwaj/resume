## Experience Details
- **Next-Gen Lidar Validation:** Validated next-generation LiDARs (including **Velarray directional** sensors) at highway cruising speeds. Engineered custom 80-20 testing jigs for diverse platforms, ensuring robust data collection for **all product lines**.
- **Infrastructure Automation (SaaS Deployment):** Pioneered the deployment strategy for Velodyne's **first-ever SaaS compute stack**. Developed **Ansible** playbooks to automate the provisioning of the **Vella vision stack** on **Jetson-based NRU** controllers, enabling scalable customer deployments.
- **Sensor Integration & Development:** Developed onboard IMU capabilities and implemented Precision Time Protocol (PTP) synchronization. Built data collection platforms integrating RTK GPS for high-fidelity georeferencing.
- **Field Engineering & Operations:** Led **7+ standardized IEAB tests** at GoMentum Station. Generated massive data annotation pipelines for **Scale AI**, supporting the training of perception models across the entire product line.
- **Strategic Technical Partnerships:** Acted as a **Hardware-Software Liaison** for key accounts (**Ford, Amazon Scout, Knightscope**). For **Bluecity** (Smart Cities), conducted **3D blindspot analysis** to optimize Lidar placement and maximize coverage efficiency.

## Raw Input
Velodyne invented Lidars. I was in the product research team. I assisted with new implemnetation of lIDARs or testing the upcoming lidars for real scenarios. I used to mke testing jigs for different systems like on rooftoop of a car for ieab testing, made data collection robptics with a wide range of possible excesoryies. 80-20 frame with custom mounting bracket. Helped develop an onboard IMU on a Lidar. Helped with the ptp sync. Helped make data collection platforms that uses RTK GPS. Managed a fleet of vehicles for gomentum station in concord. Resposible for demos or representing Velpodyne as a field application engineer.
*Update 1:* Helped over 7 IEAB standardized testing. My systems collected data at cruzing speeds supporting all the Velodyn's Lidar products including the future products like Vellaray directtional LIDARs. This effort helped us to generate massive data annotation pipilines for Scale AI.
*Update 2:* Responsible for setting up NRU systesm (jetson mased industrial controllers) for applications like Ieab, smart cities etc for which I developed ansible scripts that flashes different varients of our tech stack based on the application and requirement.
*Update 3:* This was the first time velodyne was offereing compute stack with a software as a service, So my role was to explore ansible fo automatic deployment of Vella Tech stack.
*Update 4:* Amazon Scout partnership was part of broader support for Ford, Knightscope, etc. Role was "Hardware engineer who could code" - developed software solutions to aid hardware adoption.
*Update 5:* Bluecity was also an account for smart cities for which I did blindspot analysis finding the most optimized placements of lidars for a given coverage requirement.

## AI Critique
**Role Alignment & Impact:**
- **Hybrid Expertise:** The "Hardware engineer who could code" positioning is very powerful. It solves the "integration gap" many robotics companies face.
- **Zero-to-One Impact:** Pioneering the SaaS compute stack and driving adoption with Tier-1s like Ford shows high-level influence.
- **DevOps/Infra Skillset:** Ansible/Jetson skills round out the profile nicely.
- **Consultative Engineering:** The Bluecity "blindspot analysis" highlights your ability to provide high-value technical consulting to customers.

**Improvements:**
- **Metric Opportunity:** If you can say how much faster partners integrated the Lidar because of your tools (e.g., "reduced integration time from weeks to days"), that would be a killer metric.
