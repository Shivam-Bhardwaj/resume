# Embedded Firmware Engineer – Motion Control

## About the Role
You will develop real-time embedded firmware for motor control, sensing, and safety-critical features on autonomous robots and industrial equipment. You will work closely with hardware, robotics software, and systems teams to ship robust motion platforms.

## Responsibilities
- Architect, implement, and maintain firmware for **STM32, ESP32, and low-power MCUs** in **C/Embedded C** and/or **Rust**.
- Design real-time control loops for **BLDC/servo motors**, encoders, and actuators, including current, velocity, and position control.
- Integrate a variety of sensors (IMU, encoders, limit switches, current sensors, pressure/force sensors) into a unified control stack.
- Implement robust communication interfaces (CAN, UART, SPI, I2C, Ethernet, **industrial fieldbuses such as EtherCAT/Modbus**).
- Develop bootloaders, diagnostics, and over-the-air (OTA) update mechanisms where applicable.
- Collaborate with robotics software teams to define and support APIs between firmware, **ROS/ROS2** nodes, and higher-level planners.
- Own firmware bring-up, debugging, and performance tuning using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and JTAG/SWD tools.
- Contribute to test infrastructure, including HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) and automated regression tests.

## Requirements
- B.S. or higher in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mechatronics, or related field.
- 4+ years of hands-on embedded firmware development experience for real products.
- Strong proficiency in **Embedded C**; familiarity with **Rust** for embedded systems is a plus.
- Experience with **RTOS** or bare-metal firmware for motion control or robotics applications.
- Working knowledge of **motor control** (BLDC/servo/stepper), control theory (PID, feedforward), and safety interlocks.
- Experience with **PCB design workflows** and the ability to review schematics and layout for firmware implications.
- Comfortable using lab equipment (oscilloscope, logic analyzer, multimeter) for debugging.
- Experience with version control (Git) and collaborative development workflows.

## Nice to Have
- Experience with **functional safety** concepts and standards relevant to motion control.
- Exposure to **PLC** environments (e.g., Beckhoff TwinCAT) or industrial automation projects.
- Experience integrating firmware into larger cloud/IoT or fleet-management systems.
