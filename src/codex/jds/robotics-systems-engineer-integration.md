# Robotics Systems Engineer – Sensors & Integration

## About the Role

You will own the end-to-end integration of sensors, compute, and actuators for production robotic systems in factories, warehouses, and outdoor environments. You will act as the bridge between mechanical, electrical, and software teams to bring up new robots and ensure they operate reliably at scale.

## Responsibilities

- Architect and integrate multi-sensor hardware stacks including **Lidar, cameras, IMUs, encoders, proximity sensors, and PLC-controlled I/O**.
- Design and execute system bring-up plans for new robot platforms, from bench prototypes to on-site commissioning.
- Develop and maintain **ROS/ROS2** interfaces for hardware drivers, diagnostics, and telemetry.
- Work closely with mechanical and electrical engineers to review CAD, harnessing, and PCB designs for manufacturability and serviceability.
- Build automated test rigs and fixtures to validate sensing, networking, and safety interlocks.
- Perform root-cause analysis of complex field issues involving hardware, firmware, and software interactions.
- Collaborate with manufacturing and operations teams to scale test and deployment workflows.

## Requirements

- B.S. or higher in Mechatronics, Electrical/Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, or a related field.
- 4+ years of experience in robotics systems integration or similar mechatronics roles.
- Hands-on experience with **industrial communication protocols** (e.g., **EtherCAT, Modbus, CAN**, Ethernet-based fieldbuses).
- Comfortable reading schematics, wiring diagrams, and mechanical drawings with **GD&T**.
- Experience with **PLC** or industrial controllers (e.g., **Beckhoff TwinCAT**, Siemens, Allen-Bradley).
- Proficiency in **C/C++ or Python** for writing hardware drivers, tools, and diagnostics.
- Familiarity with revision control (Git), issue tracking, and structured test documentation.

## Nice to Have

- Experience with safety standards and risk analysis for industrial robots (e.g., ISO 10218, ISO 13849).
- Background in **model-based design** or **MBD** workflows in CAD tools such as Siemens NX or SolidWorks.
- Experience working with external vendors and contract manufacturers on custom assemblies.
