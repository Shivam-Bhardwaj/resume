# Senior Rust Developer at RustFoundation

## About the Organization
The RustFoundation stewards the Rust programming language and its ecosystem. As a Senior Rust Developer, you will work on high-impact services, tooling, and infrastructure that enable companies and open-source contributors worldwide to build safe, performant systems in Rust.

## About the Role
You will design and implement production-grade Rust services and libraries, help define best practices for async Rust at scale, and collaborate with both internal teams and the open-source community. The work spans backend APIs, distributed services, and developer tooling.

## Responsibilities
- Design and implement backend services in **Rust** using modern async stacks such as **Tokio**, **Axum**, or **Actix Web**.
- Own the full lifecycle of services: design, implementation, testing, deployment, observability, and on-call support.
- Model and persist data in relational and/or document databases (e.g., **PostgreSQL**, **SQLite**, **Redis**), including schema migrations.
- Build and maintain internal and external **APIs** (REST / gRPC / WebSocket) used by other teams and community clients.
- Improve performance and reliability through profiling, benchmarking, and targeted refactors.
- Contribute to internal **Rust crates** and shared libraries, enforcing strong APIs and documentation.
- Implement CI/CD workflows (e.g., **GitHub Actions**) to test, lint, and ship Rust code automatically.
- Containerize and deploy services to **Kubernetes** or other orchestrators, working closely with SRE/DevOps teams.
- Participate in code reviews and design discussions, mentoring other engineers in idiomatic Rust and safe concurrency.
- Collaborate with open-source maintainers and community members on language-adjacent tooling or infrastructure.

## Requirements
- 5+ years of professional software engineering experience, including 2+ years using **Rust** in production.
- Strong command of **async Rust**, futures, and ownership/borrowing semantics.
- Experience developing networked services with frameworks like **Tokio**, **Axum**, **Actix Web**, **Tower**, or similar.
- Solid understanding of **HTTP**, REST, and common backend patterns (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, caching).
- Hands-on experience with containerization (**Docker**) and orchestration (**Kubernetes**, Nomad, etc.).
- Experience with SQL and/or NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, etc.), including query optimization.
- Familiarity with observability stacks (metrics, logging, tracing) such as **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **OpenTelemetry**, or equivalents.
- Comfortable working in Linux environments and using Git, code review, and continuous integration tools.
- Strong written and verbal communication skills, particularly when collaborating in distributed teams and open-source projects.

## Nice to Have
- Contributions to the **Rust** ecosystem (crates, RFCs, language tooling, or active open-source projects).
- Experience in **systems programming** domains such as networking, databases, storage, or compilers.
- Background in **IoT**, **robotics**, or high-throughput data pipelines where Rust’s performance and safety are critical.
- Experience designing multi-tenant or globally distributed services.
- Prior involvement in developer advocacy, documentation, or technical community building.
