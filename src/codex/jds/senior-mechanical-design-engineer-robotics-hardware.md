# Senior Mechanical Design Engineer – Robotics Hardware

## About the Role
You will own the mechanical design of complex robotic assemblies, sensor pods, and AR/VR hardware, from concept through production. You will work in Siemens NX and SolidWorks to create robust, manufacturable designs for industrial and consumer environments.

## Responsibilities
- Architect electro-mechanical assemblies for **robots, fixtures, and AR/VR devices**, balancing performance, cost, and manufacturability.
- Create detailed 3D models and 2D drawings using **Siemens NX** (including **Expressions / MBD / PMI**) and/or **SolidWorks**.
- Apply **GD&T (ASME Y14.5)** and tolerance stack-ups for precision mechanisms and optics mounts.
- Drive **DFMA** reviews with manufacturing partners; select materials and processes (CNC, sheet metal, injection molding, 3D printing).
- Collaborate with electronics and firmware teams on PCB integration, harness routing, and thermal considerations.
- Build and iterate physical prototypes using **rapid prototyping** and **3D printing**, executing design experiments quickly.
- Support testing, validation, and environmental qualification for lab and field deployments.
- Maintain configuration control and BOMs, and support release through PLM systems.

## Requirements
- B.S. or higher in Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics, or related field.
- 5+ years of mechanical design experience for robotics, automation equipment, or AR/VR hardware.
- Expert-level proficiency in **Siemens NX** and/or **SolidWorks** for complex assemblies.
- Strong experience with **GD&T**, tolerance analysis, and design for manufacturability.
- Experience collaborating closely with contract manufacturers and vendors.
- Comfortable reading schematics and working with electrical engineers on PCB and harness integration.
- Hands-on experience bringing designs from prototype to production, including design changes informed by test data.

## Nice to Have
- Experience with **Model-Based Definition (MBD)** and fully annotated 3D models.
- Background in **optomechanical** design or AR display hardware.
- Experience designing test fixtures and automation tooling for manufacturing and validation.
